# CasePriceBot

Discord bot for checking total price of all cases in a csgo inventory every hour

To use you need to make a config.json and put this in it
```json
{
    "Token": "Your Token Here"
}
```
# Before you use
The code of this is really messy, this is my first python project i made in just a couple hours because i was bored. I will probably be remaking a lot of it.
